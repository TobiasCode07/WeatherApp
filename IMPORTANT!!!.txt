If want the code to work then do this:
- Register at "https://openweathermap.org"
- Grab your API key and paste it into "main.py" file in the placeholder (8 line)
- install "requests", "pycountry_convert" and "pillow"
- for "flagpy" I changed the excel file a bit but it's necessary - just download "flagpy" folder from this project

PS. Flag and weather images file will change, now they are random
